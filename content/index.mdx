# How DRM works
 
This is a guide about media DRM (Digital Rights Management) technology. Learn how things like encryption, key server and CDM works to prevent theft of audio and video. We will focus primarily on video and audio DRM systems in this guide but there are other types of DRM systems which can prevent unauthorized access to other types of content (e.g. PDFs).
